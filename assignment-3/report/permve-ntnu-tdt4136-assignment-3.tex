\section*{Problem A: Pathfinding in 2D Games}

The \texttt{a1.py} program visualizes A* search in boards with uniform costs and obstacles for A.1.2. The \texttt{a2.py} program visualizes A* search for boards with different costs for A.2.2. The programs \texttt{a3-a.py} and \texttt{a3-b.py} visualizes search using \texttt{BFS}, Dijkstra's algorithm, and A* search for boards with uniform and non-uniform costs respectively for A.3.2. All programs uses the \texttt{vi} Python library which was developed for the IT3105 module.

\subsection*{4.3.3 -- Board-1-1}

Both \ac{BFS} and Dijkstra consider a large number of states and perform almost identically. The A* strategy considers significantly fewer states, but evaluates both symmetrical possible paths to the goal. All three strategies produce optimal paths.

\showboards{board-1-1}{0.75}

\newpage
\subsection*{4.3.3 -- Board-1-2}

Both \ac{BFS} and Dijkstra consider a large number of states and perform almost identically. The A* strategy considers all nodes before the obstacle; but after exiting the obstacle it moves in a straight line towards the goal due to its heuristic. All three strategies produce optimal paths.

\showboards{board-1-2}{0.75}

\newpage
\subsection*{4.3.3 -- Board-1-3}

Both \ac{BFS} and Dijkstra consider all states in the grid. The A* strategy considers significantly fewer nodes and none after the center obstacle. Gaps of states on the ``open list'' in the right grid area can be seen for A* due to its Manhattan heuristic. All three strategies produce optimal paths.

\showboards{board-1-3}{0.75}

\newpage
\subsection*{4.3.3 -- Board-1-4}

It can be seen than \ac{BFS} and Dijkstra consider the same number of nodes; and that they continue the searches in non-goal directions further than A*. All three strategies produce optimal paths.

\newpage
\subsection*{4.3.3 -- Board-2-1}

When boards with non-uniform costs are introduced; the difference between \ac{BFS} and Dijkstra's algorithm becomes clear. \ac{BFS} follows all states outwards from the start and ignores costs. It finds the straight path to the goal; however this path is sub-optimal since costs are not uniform. Both Dijkstra and A* finds optimal paths; however A* considers slightly fewer states.

\showboards{board-2-1}{1}

\newpage
\subsection*{4.3.3 -- Board-2-2}

The \ac{BFS} search chooses a straight path which ignores path costs and ends up being quite suboptimal. Both Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search finds the optimal paths; but Dijkstra's algorithm considers a few more states than A* due to its lack of a heuristic.

\showboards{board-2-2}{1}

\newpage
\subsection*{4.3.3 -- Board-2-3}

The \ac{BFS} appears to do well in this scenario and finds a path close to the optimal. However it still traverses more water cells and mountain cells than the optimal path. Both Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search finds the optimal paths; but Dijkstra's algorithm considers a few more states than A* due to its lack of a heuristic.

\showboards{board-2-3}{1}

\newpage
\subsection*{4.3.3 -- Board-2-4}

The \ac{BFS} search traverses states equally in all directions and finds the path to the goal which is the fewest number of states away; but which has a much greater path cost than the optimal path. Both Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search finds the optimal paths; but Dijkstra's algorithm considers a few more states than A* due to its lack of a heuristic.
